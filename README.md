# Probo
A website that displays information about Professional body activities in our college.

I designed and developed this website to display the activities of Professional Bodies such as Computer Society of India (CSI) and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE).

This helps our faculty members to update info about the upcoming sessions and track the activities.
This website also helps students to look at the sessions and prepare for it. Also those who missed the session can get a gist of the session from the brief explanation provided on the website.
